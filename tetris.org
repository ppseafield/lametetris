* DONE self-tips
** use extract (Z :. 10 :. 20) (extent currentActivePiece) board
*** returns an array that is a subsection the exact size of the current piece

* DONE ponder how much sense it would make to add an instance Enum a => Random a where
** added instance (Enum a, Bounded a) => Random a 

* DONE Got the individual pieces to blit
** consider just having a backdrop instead of blitting each empty cell in the board!!!!
*** DONE backdrop is dumb, just leave empty!

* DONE rotate formula:
	flipCoords (x,y) newBlockWidth = (newBlockWidth - y - 1, x)
** x becomes y, y becomes the new x but counting from the right
** up now rotates pieces

* TODO check if piece needs to be set, and then spawn if necessary
** TODO write checkPieceShouldBeSet
** TODO write setPieceAndStartAnew
